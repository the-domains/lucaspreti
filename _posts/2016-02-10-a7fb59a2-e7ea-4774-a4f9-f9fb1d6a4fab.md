LED BY A TEAM OF WORLD-CLASS ATHLETES AND FILMMAKERS, INCLUDING A WORLD CHAMPION ROCK CLIMBER, THE COMPANY IS UNIQUELY ABLE TO CAPTURE FOOTAGE OTHER TEAMS SIMPLY CAN'T. 

THE CORAL CLIMB PRODUCES DOCUMENTARIES, COMMERCIALS AND  WEB CONTENT FROM CONCEPT TO POST-PRODUCTION. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS ITS FILMMAKING SERVICES ON A CONTRACT BASIS TO STUDIOS, BUSINESSES, AND ADVERTISING FIRMS THAT LACK THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO CAPTURE STRIKING SPORT FOOTAGE OR REACH LOCATIONS ACCESSIBLE ONLY THROUGH CHALLENGING CLIMBS. 

IN ADDITION, IT RETAINS A SELECTION OF STOCK VIDEO THAT CAN BE LICENSED OUT. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9cf01b4-e342-44d2-95fc-ff4836184ae4.png)

BOASTING A MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT COUNTS NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL, AND RAI AMONG ITS FREELANCE AND CONTRACT CLIENTS, THE CORAL CLIMB OFFERS BOTH CONVENTIONAL STEREOSCOPIC 3D FOOTAGE AND VIRTUAL REALITY, ALLOWING CLIENTS AND VIEWERS TO EXPERIENCE TRULY REMARKABLE FOOTAGE, TRANSPORTING THE AUDIENCE TO PLACES INACCESSIBLE TO MOST.
